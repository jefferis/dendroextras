Title: Extra Functions to Cut, Label and Colour Dendrogram Clusters
Type: Package
Description: Provides extra functions to manipulate dendrograms
    that build on the base functions provided by the 'stats' package. The main
    functionality it is designed to add is the ability to colour all the edges
    in an object of class 'dendrogram' according to cluster membership i.e. each
    subtree is coloured, not just the terminal leaves. In addition it provides
    some utility functions to cut 'dendrogram' and 'hclust' objects and to 
    set/get labels.
