Title: Extra functions to cut, label and colour dendrogram clusters
Type: Package
Author: Gregory Jefferis
Description: This package provides extra functions to manipulate dendrograms
    that build on the base functions provided by the stats package. The main
    functionality it is designed to add is the ability to colour all the edges
    in an object of class dendrogram according to cluster membership i.e. each
    subtree is coloured, not just the terminal leaves. In addition it provides
    some utility functions to cut dendrogram and hclust objects and to set/get
    labels.
